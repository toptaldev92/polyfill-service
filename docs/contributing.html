		<p>Polyfills are located in the <code>/polyfills</code> directory and organised by feature name.  Each polyfill directory (and subdirectory) is structured like this:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>polyfill.js</code>: Required. Code to apply the polyfill behaviour.  See <a href="#polyfill-authoring-guidelines">polyfill authoring guidelines</a>.</li>
			<li><code>polyfill-{variant}.js</code>: Optional alternative polyfills, to be used where different browsers require different polyfill implementations in order to produce the same result.  Often this is because some browsers have a prefixed or part-implemented/buggy version of the feature which can be normalised more easily and efficiently than recreating it from lower level primitives.  The variant name is arbitrary, but conventionally it is the short form of the browser name and version, if applicable, eg <code>polyfill-ie7.js</code>.  The variant name 'default' is reserved for <code>polyfill.js</code>.</li>
			<li><code>detect.js</code>: A single expression that returns true if the feature is present in the browser (and the polyfill is therefore not required), false otherwise.  Can be an IIFE.  If not present, polyfill cannot be gated (wrapped in a feature-detect).  **Must not have a trailing semicolon.**</li>
			<li><code>tests.js</code>: A set of tests written using <a href="http://mochajs.org/">mocha</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/expect.js/">expect</a>, to test the feature.  See <a href="#test-authoring-guidelines">test authoring guidelines</a>.</li>
			<li><code>update.task.js</code>: Optional alternative to <code>polyfill.js</code>. This file is used in combination with the Grunt task <code>updatelibrary</code> to create a local copy of an external polyfill.</li>
			<li><code>config.json</code>: A config file conforming to the spec below</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The config.json file may contain any of the following keys:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>browsers</code>: Object, one key per browser family name (see <a href="#browser-support">browser support</a>), with the value forming either a range or a list of specific versions separated by double pipes, idenitfying the versions to which the polyfill <em>should be applied</em>. See <a href="https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges">node-semver ranges</a>.</li>
			<li><code>aliases</code>: Array, a list of alternate names for referencing the polyfill.  In the example Modernizr names are explicitly namespaced.</li>
			<li><code>dependencies</code>: Array, a list of canonical polyfill names for polyfills that must be included prior to this one.</li>
			<li><code>license</code>: String, an <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/">SPDX</a> identifier for an <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">OSI Approved</a> license  (Or CC0 which is GPL compatible)</li>
			<li><code>repo</code>: String, the URL of the repository containing the canonical version of the polyfill, of which the version stored in the polyfills library is a copy.</li>
			<li><code>spec</code>: String, the URL of a document that is the canonical technical definition of the feature (ie. the spec, preferably with fragment referencing the specific heading)</li>
			<li><code>docs</code>: String, the URL of an online resource with the most helpful description of the feature for developers (eg. MDN)</li>
			<li><code>notes</code>: Array, Notices in markdown format that developers should be aware of, useful for deprecated features like String.prototype.contains, eg "This feature was deprecated due to poor existing native implementations, and replaced with String.prototype.includes"</li>
			<li><code>variants</code>: Object, mapping variant names to objects with individual <code>browsers</code>, <code>license</code>, <code>dependencies</code> and <code>repo</code> properties.</li>
			<li><code>build</code>: Object, used to specify how the polyfill should be built.
				<ul>
					<li><code>minify</code>: is a boolean that represents whether the source polyfill has already been minified.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Where a config file contains <code>browsers</code>, <code>license</code>, <code>dependencies</code> or <code>repo</code> properties outside of a <code>variants</code> object, those properties are interpreted as belonging to the <code>default</code> variant, and apply to the <code>polyfil.js</code> implementation.  Placing them inside <code>variants.default</code> is allowed, but optional.</p>

		<p>Example:</p>

		<pre><code>{
    "browsers": {
        "ie": "6 - 9",
        "firefox": "&lt;=20",
        "opera": "11 || 14",
        "safari": "&lt;=4",
        "ios_saf" "&lt;=6"
    },
    "aliases": [
        "modernizr:es5array"
    ],
    "dependencies": [
        "Object.defineProperties",
        "Object.create"
    ],
    "license": "MIT"
}</code></pre>

		<p>A request from IE7 would receive this polyfill, since it is targeted to IE 6-9.  It <em>may</em> also receive polyfills for <code>Object.defineProperties</code> and <code>Object.create</code>, since those are dependencies of the polyfill in this example, if those polyfills also apply in IE7.</p>

		<h3 id="polyfill-authoring-guidelines">Polyfill authoring guidelines</h3>

		<p>We are always glad to accept contributions of original polyfills as well as copies of third party polyfills maintained elsewhere.  It's important to distinguish between these, because:</p>

		<ul>
		<li><strong>original polyfills</strong> are those where the polyfill service is the canonical source of the code.  They do not have a <code>repo</code> or <code>license</code> property in their config.  Original polyfills:<ul>
			<li>inherit the license terms of the polyfill service project as a whole, and all contributions are accepted subject to the committer's agreement to our <a href='#contribution-terms'>contribution terms</a>;</li>
			<li>can be modified, tweaked and improved within the polyfill service repo;</li>
			<li>must not be wrapped in a feature detect (this is a runtime option);</li>
			<li>must not contain any polyfills for features other than the one it is intended to provide.  For example, many polyfills depend on `Object.defineProperty`, but *must not* embed a polyfill for it</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><strong>third party polyfills</strong> are maintained elsewhere can be identified by the presense of a <code>repo</code> property in their config.  Third party polyfills:<ul>
			<li>may have their own license terms, in which case a <code>license</code> property must be present in their config (which must be CC0, MIT, BSD or the URL of a compatible license);</li>
			<li>must not be modified from their original source (even stylistically) except where we have to in order to make the polyfill work in the context of the polyfill service (and where that modification doesn't make sense to the polyfill outside of the polyfill service).  All other desired changes must be made upstream;</li>
			<li>may contain embedded polyfills for things for which we already have polyfills in the service, and in general, these should be left as they are in order to maintain sync with the upstream repo, even though we could make the polyfill smaller.  Ideally, we should encourage the polyfill author to remove the embedded dependencies;</li>
			<li>may contain a feature detect.  Ideally they wouldn't, because the service will wrap the polyfill in a detect, but we'll tolerate a detect in order to maintain sync with the upstream source, provided that it is strict enough to fail in the case of broken implementations, as well as missing ones.</li>
		</ul></li>
		</ul>

		In addition, whether original or third party, if the polyfill targeting is open ended (ie it targets current versions of browsers), it <em>must</em> only make changes that create conformance with a published specification.  If it is targeted <em>only</em> at older versions of browsers, it <em>may</em> be OK to exhibit any behaviour that is likely to satisfy the needs of applications that depend on the feature.  For example, our <code>devicePixelRatio</code> polyfill in very old browsers simply returns <code>1</code> without actually measuring anything.

		<h3 id="binding">Binding to global scope</h3>

		<p>Polyfill bundles produced by the service are wrapped in the following IIFE:</p>

		<pre><code>(function(undefined) {
	// Polyfills go here
).call('object' === typeof window &amp;&amp; window || 'object' === typeof self &amp;&amp; self || 'object' === typeof global &amp;&amp; global || {});</code></pre>

		<p>This provides a safe <code>this</code> variable to which polyfills may attach properties that they want to add to global scope.  Prefer this to attaching to `window` or `self`.</p>

		<h3 id="test-authoring-guidelines">Test authoring guidelines</h3>

		<p>Polyfill service tests use Mocha and Expect, both chosen because they work in legacy browsers down to our <a href="#baseline-support">baseline</a>.  The tests must assert the behaviour that the polyfill makes consistent across browsers, which is not necessarily the entire published spec.</p>

		<p>Specifically, if part of a feature is not polyfillable in a particular browser, and yet the polyfill is still usable in that browser, omit tests for the part which cannot be polyfilled.  This ensures that the polyfill is still targeted at that browser, and consumers are able to get an accurate understanding of which parts of the feature are covered by the polyfill.  However, a comment in the test file listing aspects of the feature that are not supported is always appreciated.</p>

		<h3 id='detect-authoring-guidelines'>Detect authoring guidelines</h3>

		<p>Since polyfills are loaded in an environment with a <code>this</code> value guaranteed to be an object, detects should lean heavily on the <code>in</code> operator and build from <code>this</code>, eg:

		<pre><code>'navigator' in this &amp;&amp; 'geolocation' in this.navigator</code></pre>

		<p>Objects defined as part of ECMAScript and present in all browsers above our baseline may be assumed to be present, so this is fine:</p>

		<pre><code>'imul' in Math</code></pre>

		<h3 id="running-tests">Running tests</h3>

		<p>You can run tests in three modes:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>control</strong>: All features qualify to be tested, but no polyfills will be loaded</li>
			<li><strong>all</strong>: All features qualify to be tested, and polyfills will always be loaded</li>
			<li><strong>targeted</strong>: Only those features with polyfills targeted for the current browser will be tested, and polyfills will be loaded conditionally.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The <strong>control</strong> and <strong>all</strong> modes are used to map the compatibility of polyfills, and build the <a href="docs/assets/compat.json">compat.json</a> file. The <strong>targeted</strong> mode is used to test that the current configuration works, and is therefore used for continuous integration tests on Travis CI.</p>

		<p>Your polyfill should pass cleanly in targeted mode in all browsers.  To run the entire test suite in a local browser, run the service, and then load the test director in the browser you're testing:</p>

		<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/test/director?mode=targeted">http://127.0.0.1:3000/test/director?mode=targeted</a></p>

		<p>To run just one feature, use the test runner:</p>

		<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/test/tests?feature=Array.from&amp;mode=targeted">http://127.0.0.1:3000/test/tests?feature=Array.from&amp;mode=targeted</a></p>

		<p>The gruntfile contains tasks to run the tests on Sauce Labs, but these require API keys that are not public.  If you have your own Sauce Labs account you can run the tests by setting the <code>SAUCE_API_KEY</code> and <code>SAUCE_USER_NAME</code> environment variables, and then run:</p>

		<pre><code>grunt ci</code></pre>

		<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>

		<p>When contributing to polyfills, please follow this checklist to avoid lots of iteration on your pull request:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Make sure that the polyfill correctly implements the aspects of the spec that it seeks to emulate</li>
			<li>Write a well defined config.json:<ul>
				<li>If you do not include a license or repo, we will likely ask that you do</li>
				<li>Check whether there is a Modernizr feature-detect that detects this feature.  If so, add a <code>modernizr:</code>-prefixed alias</li>
				<li>Make sure you write valid semver ranges for each browser (if defining a range, you need spaces around the dash) and use the correct browser name key</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Provide a feature detect if it's possible to detect the feature via a JavaScript expression</li>
			<li>Make sure you write a reasonably comprehensive set of tests, and that they pass in all the browsers you have targeted</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="contributing-to-the-application">Contributing to the application</h2>

		<p>The service part of the project is pretty simple, and there are few strict conventions.  In lieu of any formal standards, try to take care to follow existing conventions.  Some of these are defined in an <code>.editorconfig</code> file.</p>

		<h2 id="browser-support">Browser support</h2>

		<p>The short names should be used in the <code>config.json</code> to configure the browser support using the <code>browsers</code> key.</p>

		<table>

		<h3 id="baseline-support">Baseline support</h3>

		<p>The polyfill service does not attempt to serve polyfills to very old browsers.  We maintain a movable baseline of browser support, which is shown in the table above and configured in <a href="https://github.com/Financial-Times/polyfill-service/blob/master/lib/UA.js">the UA module</a>.  If a request for a polyfill bundle comes from a UA that is below the baseline or unknown, the response will be:</p>

		<pre><code>/* Unsupported UA detected: ie/4.0.0
 * Version range for polyfill support in this family is: &gt;=6 */</code></pre>

		<p>In practice this means that in some cases, where polyfills have configurations targeting all versions of a browser (eg <code>"ie": "*"</code>), the polyfill will actually only be available in versions of that browser above the baseline.</p>

		<p>This feature is intended to allow simpler testing and maintenance of the service, so that the general baseline can be moved forward without having to update every polyfill config individually.</p>
